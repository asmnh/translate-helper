# Development and testing

## Automatic checks

All pull requests are checked in regards of unit tests, CodeQL analysis and overall syntax. Linter is applied automatically on every pull request, but commits are still expected to be properly linted.

As of now there is no code coverage check, and tests are somewhat incomplete - to be fixed later.
